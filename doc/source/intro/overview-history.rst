Beginnings
==========

The initial formula structure was created in 2013. The formulas were not even
called formulas back then, but states. It was time of great confusion and the
quality of newly created salt-formulas was low.


tcp cloud Era
=============

The majority of formulas were rewritten to current standard structure and were
used in production for cloud deployments. All the formulas were open-sourced
and support metadata were instroduces in 2015.


openstack-salt Project
======================

OpenStack-Salt project was OpenStack Big Tent initiative project in 2015/16 and
provided resources for installing and operating OpenStack deployments. It used
subset of the formulas and project was abandoned when tcp cloud was bought by
Mirantis.


saltstack-formulas Project
==========================

The scope of current project is much wider than management of OpenStack
installations and provides generic formula ecosystem capable of managing
multiple heterogenous infrastructures.
