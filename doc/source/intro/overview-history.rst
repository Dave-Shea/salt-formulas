`Home <index.html>`_ SaltStack-Formulas Project Introduction

Project history
===============

This project is successor of OpenStack-Salt project which under OpenStack Big
Tent initiative provided resources for installing and operating OpenStack
deployments. The scope of current project is much wider than management of
OpenStack installations and provides generic formula ecosystem capable of
managing multiple systems. This was one the main reasons we have decided to abandon the original foundation.
