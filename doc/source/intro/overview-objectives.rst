`Home <index.html>`_ SaltStack-Formulas Project Introduction

Project Objectives
==================

The project seems to bring unwanted split in Salt community with overlapping
functions. The orchestration part may be similar to the official salt formulas
but the major difference lies at meta-data model which being consistent
accross all formulas in SaltStack-Formulas project allows further functions as
dynamic monitoring, telemetry, events collecting, backups, security,
documentation or audits.  It is possible to merge the two formula worlds but
compromise has to be made on both sides and there's not yeat clear path
defined to achieve this.
